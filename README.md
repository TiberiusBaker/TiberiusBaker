### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About Me
ðŸ’¬ I am Tiberius Baker, a Full Stack Software Engineer pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science at BYU.

ðŸŒ± I am currently getting back into Front End Development in general, as my job has me mostly working with the backend.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on my portfolio of projects, and while doing so: try new things, write good clean code, and document everything as I go.

I love to read and listen to books, mostly of the fiction variety. My current obsession is "The God of Endings" by Jacqueline Holland, which follows one woman's story throughout two centuries.
